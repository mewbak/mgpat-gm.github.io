		<p>Most of the end game items are easily findable given a few years of solid casual playtime. The bulk of them have a roughly 1 in 1000-2000 games chance of dropping. One exception would be a <font class="magic">King's Bastard Sword of Haste</font> with a 1 in 6500 games chance of dropping. Given that Griswold can sell them to you, this is not terribly difficult to obtain. One item that has always stood out is the <font class="magic">Emerald Long War Bow of the Heavens</font> at a whopping 1 in 16,200 games! It is arguably not necessary as you can use an Obsidian bow and attain maxed resistance, but it is very nice to find.</p><p>When thinking about the rarest item in the game, people often go to the double cursed items. As an example, <font class="magic">Vulnerable Full Plate Mail of Weakness</font> has a 1 in 304,000(!) games chance of dropping and it is only findable in Hell difficulty. There are other base armors that can drop that combination of affixes with the same probability; Plate Mail, Field Plate, and Gothic Plate. While they each individually have a 1 in 304,000, we need to divide by the 4 possible base items to see our chance of finding any one of those. That brings us to a 1 in 76,000 games chance of stumbling across one. Other double cursed affix combinations exist to give us the same probability of dropping. Rusted/Frailty, Vulnerable/Dyslexia, Vulnerable/Atrophy, Vulnerable/Disease, and many more. If we keep dividing we eventually come to a point where having an item with a 1 in 304,000 chance of dropping is not that rare in and of itself. There are 44 possible combinations. Ergo 304,000 / 44 = 6,909. Not that rare in the grand scheme of things. Granted, not too many people spend their time farming dlvl 2 for <font class="magic">Rusted Plate of the Fool</font>. With Emerald/Heavens only(arguably) sought after in the LWB form, I consider this more impressive find.</p><p>There is one affix combination that blows these out of the water. Emerald/Slaying. It has a 1 in 2,840,000 games chance of dropping for any individual sword, axe, or club you want to find it on. There are in total 25 possible base items. That brings us to a 1 in 113,600 chance of finding any combination of Emerald/Slaying in a game. That is greater than 16 times more rare than the double cursed armors!</p><p>Why so rare? This combination does not seem possible at first. Emerald has a qlvl of 31 and Slaying is 15. Items typically cannot have a prefix that is double the suffix qlvl or visa versa. There are exceptions with Wirt and Adria of course. There is also a well known quirk in Diablo coding that comes up quite often. Diablo rounds down. But whom could drop this you might ask? There may be only one. Dreadjudge. With Dreadjudge his mlvl items is 27. You add 4 for bosses, bringing us to 31. So, he can drop items with a qlvl of 31. 31 is more than double 15, but 31 divided by 2 is 15.5. Diablo rounds this down to 15. He is the only boss that has an mlvl items of 27 and he only exists every 10 games. If he had an mlvl of 28, he would be able to drop items of qlvl 32 and below, but 32 divided by 2 is 16, so he would not drop Slaying.</p><p>Diablo uses a 32bit random number generator(system clock) for the game seed. The max possible game seeds there could be is 4,294,967,296. Assuming there are that many possible individual games, there should exist 2,526,451 individual <font class="magic">Dragon's Amulet of the Zodiac</font>. While as an example only 1,512 individual <font class="magic">Emerald Bastard Sword of Slaying</font> and 37,800 of all the Emerald/Slaying combinations exist!</p><p>These are the rarest items in the game. A close second is <font class="magic">Emerald Shield of the Wolf</font>, for similar reasons. I challenge you to decipher why, knowing Wolf is the same qlvl as Slaying and there are only 6 types of shields.

		<p>I have calculated some commonly sought after items that can be shopped in town. I do not know the probabilities of shopping items in town. Therefore, some of these might be easier to find in the dungeon. Others can only be found in shops. Some of these represent the assumed ideal level and others the lowest possible level. With Gris I am aiming for the maximum amount of slot availability at the lowest character level, and the minimum clvl at Wirt or Adria. These may or may not be the most probable character level to find the items.</p><p>Most other sought after items not on this list are found in d15. This list is not exhaustive(yet!).</p>
